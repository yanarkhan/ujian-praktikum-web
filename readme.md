# Ujian Praktikum Web

This project is created as part of a **web development practical exam**. It demonstrates the ability to build a full-stack web application, covering the following aspects:

- Designing a responsive and modern front-end interface using **React.js** and **TailwindCSS**.
- Implementing back-end APIs using **Express.js** to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Using **PostgreSQL** as the database to store and manage client data.
- Utilizing **Axios** for seamless communication between the front-end and back-end.

The project is designed to simulate real-world scenarios, such as managing client records, updating data, and building a user-friendly interface to interact with the application.
